Using ES6 Sets functionality to create a Bingo game.

Created a set of Bingo numbers to be called. One buttone created to pick a random number from the set; a second button created to display all the selected numbers in the event of a Bingo. I had to figure out how to choose a number from the set at random. After that, I needed to make sure that any given number was only generated once. I had to figure out how to remove every number from the map after having been called, so they wouldn't be called again. Once a number is booted from the set, it is added to a new set, called "bingo". Then, when the second button was clicked, it would display the contents of the new set, comprised of all the numbers that had been called.
